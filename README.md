# Tik
Tik is a simple TicTacToe game with a single player mode in which a computer actively responds to moves you make. Other features include music,
and a *hidden easter egg* :)

To install and play the game, refer to the mediafire link where you will find a downloadable .apk file which you must run on your android device.
